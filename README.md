# Excel Payroll Management Application

## Overview

This Excel-based application provides a comprehensive solution for managing payroll. It includes features for adding, removing, editing, and viewing staff, as well as entering payroll data for two weeks. The application automatically compiles all information into a final payroll sheet for easy processing.

## How to Run the Application

1. **Unblock the File:**
   - Right-click the file -> Properties -> At the bottom, ensure it says "Unblock," check that, and click "Okay."

2. **Enable Macros:**

3. **Start the Application:**

## Application Structure

The application consists of four main sheets:
1. **Staff List:** Sheet to manage the list of staff.
2. **Payroll Week 1:** Sheet to enter payroll information for week 1.
3. **Payroll Week 2:** Sheet to enter payroll information for week 2.
4. **Final Payroll:** Compiled sheet with all payroll information.

## Main Features

- **Add Staff**
- **Remove Staff**
